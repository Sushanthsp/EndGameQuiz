        <h1>The End Game!!</h1>
        <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has a total of twenty-two films released to date, with Avengers: Endgame being the most recent. In these twenty-two movies, the MCU has introduced a number of characters which includes the original Avengers team: Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor, and The Hulk. All of the films overlap with each other in some way, despite the fact that more recent films are focused on individual superhero characters (such as Ant-Man or Doctor Strange).</p>

        <p>Avengers: Endgame is sadly the end of several beloved characters and served as a wrap up for the franchise (for now). The theme of sacrifice plays a huge role in this film, where some of the characters do anything—even give up their own lives so that others could get the chance to live. There is also a lot of character development seen in this film, being that those remaining after Thanos’ snap have to come to terms that they’ve lost their loved ones forever. Some of them take it better than others that's for certain.</p>

        <p>Regardless of everything the team had gone through over the past twenty-one movies, they all manage to come together for one last battle for humanity.</p>
